# AB-Music-Translations
Repository for AB Music translation across languages

Hey yo guys,

I need help from you people for translating AB Music to different languages. I am starting translation from English to 3 languages first i.e. Hindi (India), Spanish and Portugese. If you want to help translating it to some other language, please copy strings file with suffix for your lanuguag and commit.
For e.g. if you want to provide german translations, just copy strings file to strings-de (de is internet top level domain for Germany) and start translating.

How it will work : 
I have copied english string resources to all 3 languages files, all you have to do is replace those english sentences with your language. 

For e.g. If you want to contribute to spanish translations, open up strings-es file and look up this line,

\<string name="music_is_life"\>Music is love, Music is life!\</string\>

and convert it to

\<string name="music_is_life"\>La música es amor, la música es vida!\</string\>

Similarly help translating maximum contents of the file.
